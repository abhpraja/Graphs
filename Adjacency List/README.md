Adjacency List

An adjacency list is a way to represent a graph (a collection of nodes and edges) in a simple and efficient manner.

How it works:
Each node (vertex) in the graph has a list.
In that list, you store all the nodes (vertices) that are directly connected to that node by an edge.

In simple terms:
For each node, you just list all the nodes it's connected to. This is a very common way to store graphs because it's space-efficient, especially if there are fewer edges compared to the number of nodes.
