# Graphs

A graph is a way to visually or mathematically represent relationships or connections between things. It's made up of:

Nodes (or vertices): 
These are the things being connected, like points.

Edges: 
These are the connections or relationships between the nodes.

Type of graphs:
Undirected graph: 
The connections (edges) between nodes go both ways. For example, if A is connected to B, then B is also connected to A.

Directed graph (or digraph): 
The connections (edges) have a direction. If A points to B, it doesnâ€™t mean B points back to A.

Graphs are used to solve many real-world problems like network routing, finding connections in social media, or even optimizing delivery routes.
