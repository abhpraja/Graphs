# Graphs

A graph is a way to visually or mathematically represent relationships or connections between things. It's made up of:
Nodes (or vertices): These are the things being connected, like points.
Edges: These are the connections or relationships between the nodes.

Type of graphs:
Undirected graph: The connections (edges) between nodes go both ways. For example, if A is connected to B, then B is also connected to A.
Directed graph (or digraph): The connections (edges) have a direction. If A points to B, it doesnâ€™t mean B points back to A.

Graphs are used to solve many real-world problems like network routing, finding connections in social media, or even optimizing delivery routes.
